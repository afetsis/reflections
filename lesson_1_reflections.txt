How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I compared the files line by line visually.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Can view who and when made changes. Could easily create new versions of code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros. Commit only when is needed one per logical change
    Flexibility.
    Cons. Forget to commit. save in the middle of sth.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To track changes done in all files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to find all the commits done. 
    git diff to find the differences between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It gives me the power to go back any time anywhere in my code and revert changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    File version control. Code version control.
